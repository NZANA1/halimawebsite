        <h1>I LOVE YOU HALIMA</h1>
            <P>Just another reminder of how much I love you! ...</P>
            <br>
            <p>You are good enough, smart enough, loveable enough, beautiful enough, and strong enough. Nobody has ever measured how much love the heart can hold. But I know that if someone could, they would not be able to measure the love I have for you in my heart. I love you more than you know, more than I can ever tell you.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Stupid face I  wish I could explain in words how much I love you. But I can’t because there aren’t any words to express my feelings for you. I will not let the distance get between us, even if it takes a lot of effort. We will make this relationship work.</p>
